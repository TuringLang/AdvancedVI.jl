# Release 0.6

This update adds new variational inference algorithms in light of the flexibility added in the v0.5 update.
Specifically, the following measure-space optimization algorithms have been added:

- `KLMinWassFwdBwd`

# Release 0.5

## Default Configuration Changes

The default parameters for the parameter-free optimizers `DoG` and `DoWG` has been changed.
Now, the choice of parameter should be more invariant to dimension such that convergence will become faster than before on high dimensional problems.

The default value of the `operator` keyword argument of `KLMinRepGradDescent` has been changed to `IdentityOperator` from `ClipScale`. This means that for variational families `<:MvLocationScale`, optimization may fail since there is nothing enforcing the scale matrix to be positive definite.
Therefore, in case a variational family of `<:MvLocationScale` is used in combination with `IdentityOperator`, a warning message instruting to use `ClipScale` will be displayed.

## Interface Changes

An additional layer of indirection, `AbstractVariationalAlgorithms` has been added.
Previously, all variational inference algorithms were assumed to run SGD in parameter space.
This design however, has proved to be too rigid.
Instead, each algorithm is now assumed to implement three simple interfaces: `init`, `step`, and `output`.

A new specialization of `estimate_objective` have been added that takes the variational algorithm `alg` as an argument.
Therefore, each algorithm should now implement `estimate_objective`.
This will automatically choose the right strategy for estimating the associated objective without having to worry about internal implementation details.

## Internal Changes

The state of the objectives `state` may now use a concrete type.
Therefore, to be able to dispatch based on the type of `state` while avoiding type ambiguities, the `state` argument in `estimate_gradient!` has been moved to the front.

Under the new interface `AbstractVariationalAlgorithms`, the algorithms running SGD in parameter space, currently `KLMinRepGradDescent`, `KLMinRepGradProxDescent`, `KLMinScoreGradDescent`, are treated as distinct algorithms.
However, they all implicitly share the same `step` function in `src/algorithms/common.jl` and the same fields for the `state ` object.
This may change in the future.
